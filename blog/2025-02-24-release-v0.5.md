We're releasing Ark v0.5 as a maintenance-focused update that improves overall efficiency and user experience. Though the changes are incremental, they should make a noticeable difference for people who regularly participate in Ark rounds and want smoother signing sessions with fewer hassles.

## üÜï New Features

### ‚úçÔ∏è Branch-only VTXO Tree Signing

The new release changes how you sign VTXO trees. Previously, you needed to sign the entire tree of transactions, which became computationally heavy in large rounds. Now, clients only have to sign their own branches. This shift drastically cuts down on the number of signatures you have to produce, making rounds quicker and less resource-intensive. If you'd prefer to keep signing the entire tree ‚Äî or delegate parts of the signing to another party ‚Äî that flexibility is still there.

This streamlined approach benefits anyone who joins bigger rounds, where signing time was becoming a bottleneck. It's also more convenient if you have limited computing power or simply don't want to wait around as your client churns through every single transaction in the tree.

###  üîó Connectors tree

Another notable addition is the move from a linear connector chain to a tree structure. Previously, you had to sign a forfeit transaction for every single VTXO spent in a round, which could add up quickly. Now, each VTXO only needs one forfeit transaction. This effectively lightens the load when you join a round, as you no longer have to sign multiple forfeit transactions for each of your spent VTXOs.

On the server side, we've set a constant number of transactions to broadcast if there's fraud, ensuring the server can react swiftly without drowning clients in excessive signatures. These changes are designed to make it easier and faster for you to participate, while still giving the server enough control to handle malicious behavior efficiently.

##  üõ†Ô∏è Optimizations

###  üåê Network Compatibility and Transaction Costs

Ark now runs on any Bitcoin network except TestNet4, which we plan to support once we address related dependencies. We've also introduced an optional configuration that removes the minimum relay fee for redeem transactions, though that means these transactions won't get mined in worst-case scenarios. This is mostly a preview of the future state of Ark once Bitcoin v29 lands with support for 0-value anchor outputs.

This expansion benefits users who run Ark on specialized Bitcoin networks, as you can choose the environment that best fits your needs without worrying about compatibility or relays.

### üîÑ Round Processing and Client Interaction

We've tightened up server-side handling of "noise" so that redundant or invalid actions don't slow things down for everyone else. If your client isn't chosen for a round, it will simply wait for the next one instead of wasting resources sending data it can't use.

By ignoring non-relevant transactions and signatures, the server keeps each round more predictable. You'll spend less time dealing with weird errors or repeated signing requests, letting everyone progress through the round more smoothly.

### üìà Scalability Improvements

This update also makes it easier for the server to handle bigger rounds. The VTXO tree and forfeit transactions creation and  verifications are faster, so you shouldn't see a significant slowdown when the participant count rises.

We've made changes to the core of the server and replaced fixed timeouts between the stages of the round with a more dynamic approach that moves to the next one as soon as all required data is in. If participants sign quickly, you can expect the round to conclude faster ‚Äî no more waiting on an arbitrary timer once everything's ready.

### üíª Client SDK API Update

To make onchain operations clearer, we've replaced the old SendOnChain method with more focused functions such as OnboardAgainAllExpiredBoardings, WithdrawFromAllExpiredBoardings, and CompleteUnilateralExit. We've also introduced new naming conventions: CollaborativeRedeem becomes CollaborativeExit, and UnilateralRedeem becomes StartUnilateralExit.

For better responsiveness, there's a new GetVtxoEventChannel API that keeps you informed about changes in your VTXO set in near real time. This is especially useful if your application needs to respond quickly to state changes ‚Äî like updating a user's balance display as soon as it becomes spendable.

## Conclusion

Ark v0.5 is about refining the experience for active participants. By reducing the number of transactions you need to sign, speeding up rounds, and simplifying how forfeits work, we aim to lessen the overhead so you can focus on what matters. We encourage anyone who wants a more efficient Ark workflow to upgrade and share any feedback or questions you have. It's a small but meaningful step toward a more robust, user-friendly Ark.
