# Ark v0.3.0: Enhanced Security, Improved Efficiency, and Extended Functionality

**Greetings, Arkonauts! üöÄ**

We're excited to announce the release of Ark v0.3.0, a significant update that brings substantial improvements in security, efficiency, and functionality. This release marks a major step forward in our journey to create a more robust and user-friendly Ark ecosystem.

## üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Security and Trust Model

### MuSig2 Tree Signing

One of the most significant improvements in this release is the implementation of MuSig2 for VTXO tree signing. This enhancement removes the need for trust between clients and the server when completing a round. Round participants now collectively sign the VTXO tree, ensuring a more decentralized and secure process.

### Validation in Async Payments

We've added validation checks in the `CompleteAsyncPayment` RPC. The client now verifies that all signatures of transactions created in an async payment are valid, removing the trust required between client and server.

## üöÄ Improved Efficiency

### Non-Interactive Boarding Protocol

We've simplified the onboarding process with a non-interactive boarding protocol. Users can now join Ark by simply sending funds to a boarding address. Once confirmed on-chain, users co-sign with the ASP while claiming the UTXO in a round.

### Dynamic Fee and Dust Amount Handling

Ark now dynamically fetches dust amounts and minimum relay fees based on chain activity, replacing hardcoded values. This improvement allows for more accurate and efficient transaction processing.

## üîß Extended Functionality

### Enhanced Client SDK

We've exported `ListVtxos` and `GetTransactionHistory` in the SDK, providing developers with more powerful tools to build on Ark.

### Reversible Policy for Pending VTXOs

When making an async payment, senders now have the ability to revert it if the receiver doesn't claim it. While the server doesn't yet expose an API for this, the groundwork has been laid in the output script.

### Chain Async Payments

Change produced in async payments is now immediately spendable without needing to be claimed. This improvement unlocks the ability to chain async payments, allowing for more flexible and efficient off-chain transactions.

## üß™ Improved Testing

We've expanded our e2e testing suite to include adversarial scenarios. These tests ensure the server behaves correctly when clients attempt to cheat, further solidifying Ark's security model.

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Experience

### CLI with Ark SDK

The Ark CLI is now built on top of the client SDK, serving as a reference implementation for developers.

### API Renaming

We've renamed several APIs to be more production-oriented, improving clarity and consistency across the platform.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To start using Ark v0.3.0, update your installations and check out our [updated documentation](https://arkdev.info) for detailed guides on the new features.

We're thrilled about these improvements and can't wait to see what you'll build with Ark v0.3.0. As always, we welcome your feedback and contributions to make Ark even better.

Happy building, Arkonauts!
