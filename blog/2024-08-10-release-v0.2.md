**Greetings, Arkonauts! üöÄ**

We're thrilled to announce the [release of Ark v0.2](https://github.com/ark-network/ark/releases/tag/v0.2.0), a significant milestone in our journey. This update brings exciting new features and improvements, including covenant-less Ark implementation, offline payments, client SDKs, and substantial enhancements to our codebase and documentation.

## üßê What's New?

### Covenant-less Ark

The Go implementation now supports covenant-less Ark, enabling seamless integration with the Bitcoin network. Building on our initial [Rust prototype](https://github.com/ark-network/clArk) from the previous months, we've successfully merged covenant-less version for Bitcoin in the [arkd server](https://github.com/ark-network/ark/pull/214)  and in the [ark client](https://github.com/ark-network/ark/pull/225), alongside the covenant version for the Liquid Network. This advancement allows users to leverage the Ark protocol on the Bitcoin network without requiring a covenant soft-fork.

### Offline Payments

We've introduced offline payment support in the Go implementation, significantly enhancing user flexibility. Leveraging the [Ruben shortcut](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/a394beb1dea9e47e981216768e007454?permalink_comment_id=4633382#gistcomment-4633382) as the default [Payment protocol](/docs/learn/payments), senders can now co-sign transactions with the ASP (Ark Service Provider) and deliver payment requests directly to recipients.

This approach allows recipients to join the next round to enter into the next [VTXO tree](/docs/learn/concepts#vtxo-tree) when they come back online, without needing to be online at the time of the sender's payment request. It's a game-changer for users who need to send payments in areas with limited internet connectivity or unreliable data service.

### Client SDKs

We're excited to introduce new client SDKs that make integrating Ark into your projects easier than ever. We now offer both Go and JavaScript (WASM) SDKs, providing flexibility for various development environments.

Our Go SDK allows seamless integration with Go-based projects. Here's a quick example of how to create a new Ark wallet:

```go
import "github.com/ark-network/ark-sdk"

// Example code to be added here
```

## üöÄ Get Started

Head over to our [Developer Portal](https://arkdev.info) to explore the latest documentation and resources. We've updated our guides to reflect the new features and improvements in Ark v0.2, making it easier than ever to get started with the protocol.

We recommend following our [Quick Start Guide](/docs/quick-start/intro) to set up a local Bitcoin regtest network and run the Ark implementation on top of it. This will help you understand the protocol better and test the new features in a controlled environment.

Happy coding, Arkonauts! We can't wait to see what you'll build with Ark v0.2! üíªüåü
