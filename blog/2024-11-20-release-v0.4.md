**Greetings, Arkonauts! 🚀**

We're pleased to announce the release of Ark v0.4, bringing exciting new features and improvements that enhance flexibility, usability, and reliability of the Ark ecosystem. Let's dive into what's new and improved in this latest version!

## 🎉 What's New?

### 🔐 New Address Encoding

We've made a significant change to our address encoding format. Instead of encoding user and Server public keys, we now encode the VTXO output script (Taproot key) and Server public key. This shift unlocks a world of possibilities:

- The Server can create a VTXO for any kind of Ark address, including custom ones
- Enable an ecosystem of services built on top of Ark
- Increase flexibility for developers and users alike

This change paves the way for more innovative applications and use cases within the Ark network. You can do your own experiments by interacting with our public Ark server [server_url] <!-- TODO: add url -->

### 📝 Ark Notes

Introducing Ark Notes, a feature designed for users who may not be online frequently. Here's how it works:

- Clients can share a Nostr public key (profile) for their VTXOs
- When users go offline, the Server will print notes worth their unspent swept VTXOs
- Users can restore their off-chain balances when they come back online in the future

This feature enhances the usability of Ark for users with intermittent connectivity, ensuring they don't miss out on the benefits of the network.

### ⏰ Market Hours

We're excited to introduce the concept of Market Hours to the Ark ecosystem:

- Market Hours are specific periods during which the server will offer lower service fees for users joining rounds
- This feature allows users to schedule their settlements at predetermined times in the future, potentially saving on fees
- In v0.4, the server is implementing the announcement of Market Hours, laying the groundwork for full implementation in a future release

## 🛠️ Server Improvements

We've also made several enhancements to the Ark Server:

- Support for restoration of the internal Bitcoin wallet
- Connection of the internal Bitcoin wallet to bitcoind with ZMQ
- Auto-unlock feature for the internal wallet
- Increased testing surface for improved reliability
- Consolidation of APIs, including renaming of RPCs and message fields for better consistency

These improvements contribute to a more robust and reliable Ark Server.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To start leveraging these exciting new features in Ark v0.4, update your installations and check out our <a href="../docs/provider/intro" target="blank">updated documentation</a> for detailed guides on how to implement and use these new capabilities.

We're eager to see how you'll utilize these new features to create even more powerful and flexible applications on the Ark network. As always, we welcome your feedback and contributions to help us continue improving Ark.

Happy building, Arkonauts! Let's take Ark to new heights together! 🌟
