## üï¥Ô∏è Actors

### ASP

Ark Service Providers, or **ASPs** in short, are always-on servers that provide liquidity to the network, similar to how Lightning service providers work. The ASP is responsible for creating new [VTXOs](#vtxo) and broadcasting periodically the [Round transactions](#round-transaction) and it's incentivized by the fees charged on the virtual UTXOs created. Each of these rounds expire after a certain period of time, to allow ASP to reclaim the Bitcoin liquidity locked on-chain, unless the user decides to refresh their VTXOs and pay the liquidity provider fees again.

### Users

**Users** are the ones who sends and receive VTXOs, virtual UTXOs that can be transformed in UTXO at any time, but are kept off-chain for cheaper and faster settlements of Bitcoin payments. They can unilaterally exit their funds from the Ark to the mainchain without asking the ASP for permission, assuming the cost of the on-chain transaction to exit is not greater than the value of the VTXO being spent.

## üìù Contracts and Primitives
:::note
All time periods used on timelocks (**5s**, **24h**, **4w**, **1y**) are arbitrary: each ASP can use different values.

### VTXO

A Virtual UTXO, or VTXO in short, is a Bitcoin transaction output that can be spent off-chain and can be redeemed on-chain at any time. A VTXO is the leaf of the [VTXO tree](#vtxo-tree) to which the [Shared Output](#shared-output) of a [round transaction](#round-transaction) commits to. The VTXO refers to a set of transactions owned by a user, whose validity cannot be revoked by anyone, allowing the user to create a specific UTXO on the blockchain if needed.

A VTXO should appear on-chain only if the VTXO owner decided to unilaterally exit the Ark. It's locked by a taproot script that has 2 closures

1. **Redeem** lets the user to spend the VTXO unilaterally after a CSV delay. The delay requires the tx to be onchain, so the user can use it only by unrolling a tree. The delay allows the ASP to broadcast a forfeit tx if VTXO was already spent off-chain.
2. **Forfeit** expects both parties (owner and ASP) to sign the spending transaction. It is used to forfeit the VTXO off-chain and give it back to the ASP when it's spent.

```hack
(Alice + ASP) OR (Alice after 24h)
```

### VTXO Tree

VTXOs are created by a [shared output](#shared-output). The root of the VTXO tree spends the shared output and splits it into 2 other shared outputs, which are respecively split into other 2 shared outputs, etc. At the leaf level of this binary tree we find the VTXOs of the round participants.

![An image from the static](/img/vtxo-tree.png)

- Represents a tree of virtual transactions on the blockchain
- In an optimistic scenario, this tree is never revealed
- Each leaf on this tree represents a [VTXO](#vtxo)

### Shared Output

A shared output is a bitcoin transaction output locked by a taproot script with 2 tapscript closures:

1. **Unroll** forces the spending transaction format. A shared output can be spent only by being split into 2 other sub-shared outputs. This gives the tree the shape of a binary tree.
2. **Sweep** lets the Ark Service Provider to spend a shared output after a timeout.

### Rounds

Ark payments traditionally occur in scheduled rounds organized by the ASP. During these rounds, users with a VTXO in the Ark can request the ASP to include their new virtual transactions output. The ASP then creates a new [shared output](#shared-output) that aggregates all the payments from that round.
To participate, users sign an off-chain [forfeit transaction](#forfeit-transaction), transferring their input VTXO to the ASP. In exchange, the ASP generates a new shared on-chain UTXO containing the desired output VTXOs and broadcasts the transaction.

A round transaction typically has two outputs: a _Shared Output_ that commits to a VTXO tree, and a _Connector Output_ that commits to a chain of connectors.

### Connectors

Connectors are used to ensure atomicity when forfeiting VTXOs in exchange for others in a new VTXO tree, ie. spending a VTXO by joining a round.

As introduced before, a round transaction typically has two outputs: a _Shared Output_ that commits to a VTXO tree, and a _Connector Output_ that commits to a chain of connectors.

A connector is a dust value ouptut that _connects_ a forfeit tx to the round tx in which a VTXO is spent. A connector is simply used as input of a forfeit tx and is signed by the ASP only. It's purpose is to force the forfeit tx to be broadcastable only if the round one is broadcasted as well. This is a guarantee for the user that there's no way the ASP can use his signatures to double-spend a VTXO.

![connectors](/img/connectors.png)
In this example Alice owns a 10k sats VTXO and joins a round to send 2k sats to Bob.
The ASP creates the next VTXO tree with the new VTXOs, and a chain of connectors for each spent (forfeited) VTXO, included the one used in Alice's forfeit tx.


## ‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• Transactions

### Boarding transaction

- Alice funds an output that can be **accepted as a VTXO** in a future round
- **Alice** can unlock after a timeout ie. _6 months_
- **Alice and ASP** can cooperate to include the UTXO as input of a [round transaction](#round-transaction)

| Inputs       | Outputs                                                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alice‚Äôs UTXO | `(Alice after 6 months) or (Alice + ASP)`                         |


### Forfeit transaction

- Insurance for the ASP, in case Alice tries to double spend her VTXO after spending it inside Ark
- Before the ASP funds Bob‚Äôs VTXO in the next Round transaction, he must receive this transaction signed by Alice
- Uses a connector from the next Round transaction to achieve atomicity

| Inputs                               | Outputs |
| ------------------------------------ | ------- |
| VTXO spending `Alice + ASP`          | `ASP`   |
| Connector from next Round transaction |

### Round transaction

- Funded by the ASP, creates VTXOs.
- Has at least two outputs:
  - A shared output with a VTXOs tree
  - A connectors output with a connectors tree
- A new transaction is periodically broadcasted by the ASP to create new VTXOs. 

| Inputs   | Outputs           |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| ASP UTXO | Shared output     |
|          | Connectors output |
