### 🤔 Why Ark?

Bitcoin is the world's most secure and censorship-resistant blockchain. However, it's not the fastest or the cheapest. Ark is a layer-two protocol designed to scale Bitcoin transactions. It uses a shared UTXO model for off-chain payments through an intermediary server that cannot access your funds.

### 🧐 Does Ark require covenants?

No (but they improve Ark a lot!). A covenant-less version of **Ark is possible on Bitcoin** today!
Through the documentation, we will refer to the covenant-less version as **clArk** and the covenant version as **Ark**. To better understand the impact of covenants and the drawbacks of clArk, check out the [Ark vs clArk](./learn/clark) page to see the differences between the two implementations.

### 📜 How Does Ark Work?
