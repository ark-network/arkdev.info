### ü§î Why Ark?

Bitcoin is the world's most secure and censorship-resistant blockchain. However, it's not the fastest or the cheapest. Ark is a layer-two protocol designed to scale Bitcoin transactions. It uses a shared UTXO model for off-chain transactions through an intermediary server that cannot access your funds.

### üìú How Does Ark Work?

Head over to our [Learn](./learn/concepts) section to understand the Ark protocol in detail.

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Running Ark
