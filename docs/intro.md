title: Introduction

Ark is a scaling solution for Bitcoin that involves **moving transactions off-chain**. Ark executes transactions outside of the Bitcoin main chain but posts transaction data back on-chain in a compressed format.
Ark servers bundle multiple off-chain transactions into large batches before submitting them to the Bitcoin blockchain. This method spreads fixed costs across multiple transactions in each batch, significantly reducing fees for end-users.

### üìú How Does Ark Work?

Head over to our [Learn](./learn/concepts) section to understand the Ark protocol in detail.

### ‚õπÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Use cases

- Scaling of other protocols that leverage UTXO model such as tokens, channels or swaps.
- Create a Bitcoin wallet for your users with cheap and fast transactions.
- Rebalance Lightning Network channels.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Integrate Ark

You can [integrate Ark](./developers/get-started.md) into your wallet or application to enable "virtual" bitcoin transactions. Check out our Wallet SDKs for Go and JavaScript, soon also Rust and Python.

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Running Ark

You can join an existing Ark Server or run your own on Bitcoin or Liquid. To get started, follow the guides below:
