## What is the Ark Wallet CLI?

The Ark Wallet CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool that allows users to interact with the Ark protocol directly from their terminal. It provides a streamlined way to manage your Ark wallet, conduct transactions, and interact with Ark Service Providers (ASPs) without the need for a graphical interface.
